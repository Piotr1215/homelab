# Service Resilience Scoring: Google Drive

This document scores Google Drive as a third-party dependency using the five heuristics from the personal resiliency framework. Each heuristic is scored using a traffic light system:
- 🟢 Green: Strong
- 🟡 Yellow: Adequate but could be improved
- 🔴 Red: Weak or absent

The goal is to identify which aspects of your relationship to Google Drive are resilient and which need attention.

## Heuristic Scoring

| Heuristic | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Robustness** | 🔴 | Google Drive loss means **immediate loss of access to all files**. Cannot access documents, spreadsheets, presentations, or any stored files. Shared files with collaborators become inaccessible. Work stoppage. |
| **Redundancy** | 🔴 | **No backup by default**. Most users have no local copies or alternative storage. Files exist only in Google's cloud. No automatic sync to other providers. Collaborators have copies but not organized/complete. |
| **Resourcefulness** | 🟡 | Can export via Google Takeout (if account accessible). Can manually download important files. Could switch to Dropbox/OneDrive but requires time. Collaboration features harder to replace (Docs/Sheets/Slides). |
| **Rapidity** | 🟡 | If you have backups: **minutes to hours** to access from alternative location. Without backups: **days** (Google Takeout takes time, account recovery delays). Migration to new provider: **hours to days** depending on data volume. |
| **Decoupling** | 🟡 | Files can be moved to other providers but shared links break. Collaborators need new sharing method. Google Workspace integration (Docs/Sheets/Slides) creates lock-in. Some formats don't export perfectly (especially Slides). |

## Current State Analysis

### What Google Drive Provides
- **File Storage**: 15GB free (or more with paid plan)
- **File Sync**: Automatic sync across devices
- **Collaboration**: Real-time document editing with others
- **Office Suite**: Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms (native formats)
- **File Sharing**: Public/private link sharing with permissions
- **Version History**: Automatic versioning and recovery
- **Integration**: Deep integration with Gmail, Calendar, Photos
- **Mobile Access**: Access files from any device

### Typical Usage Patterns
Google Drive commonly stores:
- **Personal Documents**: Tax records, medical records, legal documents, resumes
- **Work Files**: Projects, presentations, reports, contracts
- **Shared Collaborations**: Team documents, event planning, shared spreadsheets
- **Backups**: Photos, scanned documents, important files
- **Active Projects**: Documents actively being worked on
- **Archives**: Old files that "live in the cloud"

### Critical vs. Non-Critical Data
- **Critical**: Tax documents, legal contracts, medical records, important photos, work deliverables
- **Non-Critical**: Temporary files, downloaded PDFs, cached content, easily re-creatable items

## Risk Scenarios

### High-Impact Scenarios

1. **Account Suspension/Lockout**:
   - Google locks account for ToS violation or suspicious activity
   - Cannot access any files
   - Cannot download via Takeout during suspension
   - Shared links stop working
   - Collaborators lose access to your shared files
   - **Recovery**: Appeal to Google (days/weeks), hope for account restoration

2. **Data Loss Event (Rare)**:
   - Google experiences data loss (extremely rare but possible)
   - Files permanently deleted
   - Version history lost
   - No recovery from Google
   - **Recovery**: Only from personal backups (if they exist)

3. **Accidental Deletion + Trash Emptied**:
   - Delete important folder
   - Empty trash (30-day recovery window missed)
   - Files permanently gone
   - **Recovery**: Only from backups, version history won't help

4. **Ransomware via Sync**:
   - Device gets ransomware
   - Google Drive sync spreads encryption to cloud
   - All files encrypted in Drive
   - Version history might help but ransomware can overwrite multiple versions
   - **Recovery**: Restore from external backup or hope version history has clean copies

5. **Format Lock-In Issues**:
   - Heavy use of Google Docs/Sheets/Slides native format
   - Export to Office formats loses formatting/features
   - Switch to another provider = broken workflows
   - **Recovery**: Manual conversion and reformatting (tedious)

### Recovery Time Estimates
- **With daily backups**: Minutes (access backup location)
- **With weekly backups**: Minutes to hours (RPO: up to 7 days data loss)
- **With Google Takeout (account accessible)**: 2-24 hours (Takeout processing time)
- **Account locked, no backup**: Days to weeks (dependent on Google support)
- **Data permanently lost**: No recovery possible

Example:
- 100GB in Google Drive
- 256GB external SSD ($50)
- 200GB Backblaze B2 ($1/month)

## Backup Tool Recommendations

### For Your Homelab (Kubernetes + MinIO)

1. **Rclone** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Install on one of your K8s nodes or as CronJob
   rclone sync gdrive: /mnt/nas/drive-backup --log-file /var/log/rclone.log
   rclone sync gdrive: minio:drive-backup
   rclone sync gdrive: b2:drive-backup
   ```
   - Free, open source
   - Supports 40+ cloud providers
   - Can run as K8s CronJob
   - Perfect for your setup

2. **Nextcloud** (Best Long-Term)
   - Deploy on your K8s cluster (Helm chart available)
   - Use MinIO as backend (you already have this!)
   - Sync files from Drive → Nextcloud → MinIO → External backup
   - Full Google Drive replacement
   - Calendar, contacts, office suite included

## Self-Hosted Solution Architecture

Since you have a homelab with Kubernetes and MinIO:

```yaml
Workstation
    ↓ (Nextcloud client sync)
Nextcloud (K8s Pod)
    ↓ (S3 API)
MinIO (K8s Pod)
    ↓ (local-path PVC)
Node Storage
    ↓ (rclone sync CronJob)
Backblaze B2 (off-site)
```

This gives you:
- ✅ Full control (no Google dependency)
- ✅ Automatic backup to external cloud
- ✅ Access from anywhere (Cloudflare Tunnel)
- ✅ Multi-device sync
- ✅ Version history
- ✅ Collaboration features

## Recommended Approach

**Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Quick wins - Drive Desktop, critical file backup
**Phase 2 (Month 1)**: Automated backups with rclone
**Phase 3 (Months 2-3)**: Multi-cloud backup strategy (Drive + Backblaze)
**Phase 4 (Months 4-6)**: Deploy Nextcloud on homelab
**Phase 5 (Months 7-12)**: Full migration, Drive becomes backup only

This staged approach provides immediate risk reduction while building toward full independence.

## Conclusion

Google Drive is a **high-risk dependency** due to data centralization without default backups. Unlike Gmail (identity problem), Drive is a **data problem** - much easier to solve with proper backup strategy. The good news: backups are fully in your control and can be implemented quickly.

**Overall Resilience Score: 🔴 High Risk - No Backup**
**With Backups: 🟢 Low Risk - Well Protected**
**Recommended Action: Immediate - Start backups this week**

**Key Risk**: Single copy of data in Google's control
**Key Solution**: 3-2-1 backup strategy (can implement in hours)
**Best Long-Term**: Self-hosted Nextcloud on your existing homelab
**Critical Insight**: Data resilience is in your control - don't rely on Google's infrastructure alone
